Is a no-BS guide to making your website look modern.I'm not going to drag this out for 40 minutes, tell you generic advice, and then admit you need to learn graphic design anyway. This is real advice where I don't waste your time. By far the easiest way to improve your website is just to copy others. It's not unethical; you're just not reinventing the wheel. Find something that you like and build it yourself. The ideas will stick, and you'll create something already thought out without the time waste. The best place to find good websites are from portfolios. I left a link to a giant list of portfolios in the description! Using premade libraries is also a great way to modernize your website. They'll save you time and allow you to polish your website without overbuilding it. Depending on your framework, search up your framework's name and then component library, and you'll find what you need. Use animation or motion libraries to allow your website to flow well! Here's a quick list of each framework and their best library. In addition, subtle animations on hover, clicking, etc. in CSS are also great.Fonts can make or break a website. Thankfully, you can just copy it off someone else, so don't worry too much about this. Just use one font and utilize its weight, style, and capitalization. Your color palette is important. Use a website like Coolers to find it.They try to make me use an affiliate link, but please don't pay for anything you don't need to. In terms of graphics and images, especially for us who aren't artistically blessed, use SVG repo for icons, Unsplash for images, and High Key or background graphics. These are all free and are great for modern looks. All the links are in the description. This is a short video, but it is just as comprehensive without wasting your time. So leave a comment if you appreciate.
