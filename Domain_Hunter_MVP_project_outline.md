AI agents that finds expired dotcom domains

every day 50,000 domain names expire. most are garbage but hidden in there are gems - domains with real traffic, clean backlinks, brandable names that someone will pay thousands for.

domain investors know this. they make serious money buying expired domains for $100 and flipping them for $5k+.  i did this when i was younger but finding the good ones is pure torture.

right now they manually download massive lists of expiring domains, then spend hours checking each one. does it have traffic? clean backlink history? is the name brandable? by the time they finish analyzing 50 domains, the best ones are already gone.

this is exactly what AI agents are built for. pattern recognition at machine speed.

how it works:

your ai agent watches all the domain drop lists 24/7. it checks each domain's traffic history, backlink quality, spam scores, and brandability. when it finds a winner, it texts you: "XYZ domain dropping tomorrow. 5k monthly visitors, mentioned in techcrunch, estimated auction price $300."

how to build it:

weekend mvp: connect to daily domain drop feeds, run everything through a scoring algorithm, send sms alerts via twilio when something hits your criteria. plug in apis like majestic seo and similarweb for traffic data. charge $99/month to beta users.

how to grow it:

start with 100 beta customers paying $99/month. these people currently spend 2+ hours per day doing this manually, so you're literally paying them to use your product.

wont be easy to find first 100 customers. maybe you'll have to create tons of yt content, x content around what you're seeing out there, but i do think its possible.

scale to 1,000 customers = $1.2m arr. your only real costs are data feeds and servers and your team. but this could be a 1 person biz with contractors.

add features: auto-bidding at auctions, one-click listing to marketplace sites, private deals for agencies. each new feature makes manual competitors look like cavemen.

why i like AI agent businesses like this domain startup idea (and how to find them)

look for markets where people are: → doing repetitive, boring work that requires pattern recognition → monitoring multiple data sources 24/7 (impossible for humans) → already paying significant time/money for manual solutions → making real money when they find opportunities (so they won't churn) → working in industries where speed = competitive advantage

the best ai agent businesses solve problems that are too tedious for humans but too valuable to ignore. find the digital needle-in-haystack problems where people are burning hours for clear ROI.
